# Customer Behavior Machine Learning Project

This project is a small, educational machine learning project designed to demonstrate core concepts from the Machine Learning Specialization.

## Project Goals
- Predict customer purchase behavior using supervised learning
- Segment customers using unsupervised learning
- Build a simple recommendation system

## Methods Used
- Logistic Regression
- K-Means Clustering
- Collaborative Filtering

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a publicly available customer behavior dataset.
(The exact source will be documented later.)

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing data analysis and models
- `data/`: Dataset files
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
2. Open the notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab

## Notes
This project focuses on clarity and learning rather than production-level optimization.
